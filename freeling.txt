To compile Freeling from SVN you can pretty much follow the
instructions on the website.  For Ubuntu 14.04 LTS these are the
packages needed:

apt-get install build-essential automake autoconf libtool subversion\
        libboost-regex-dev libicu-dev libboost-system-dev\
        libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev
  
HOWEVER, I am still getting the following error while trying to run.
The /usr/local/lib is included in ld.conf.

$ analyzer
analyzer: error while loading shared libraries: libfreeling-4.0-devel.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
